# Setting Routes

Once your web services of the application deployed, you can visit it locally via `port-forward` or
from outside world via `route` feature. 

```console
$ vela svc ls
NAME  	    APP  	WORKLOAD  	  TRAITS	STATUS 	    CREATED-TIME
frontend	testapp	webservice	      	    Deployed	2020-09-18 22:42:04 +0800 CST
```

## `port-forward`

It will directly open browser for you.

```console
$ vela port-forward testapp
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 80
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 80

Forward successfully! Opening browser ...
Handling connection for 8080

```

## `route`

`route` is mainly used for public visiting your app.

### If you have didn't configure domain in environment

You can manually configure it by setting domain parameter.

```console
$ vela route testapp --domain frontend.mycustom.domain
